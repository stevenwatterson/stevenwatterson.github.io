With [Laura Lackner][lackner]'s group' at Northwestern, we've just been awarded two years of collaborative funding to study how older cells retain stress-triggered aggregates by tethering aggregates to organelles. Thanks to the Chicago Biomedical Consortium, and the Searle Funds at The Chicago Community Trust, for this [Catalyst award][catalyst].
