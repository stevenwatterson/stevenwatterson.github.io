*Background**

At Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine, Ulster University, UK, we have recruited approx. 2500 patients across a range of immune and pro-inflammatory diseases and have collected their clinical data, genome sequence data and protein activity data in order to stratify patients into specific sub-groups depending on disease and treatment characteristics.  Our research is focused on following range of degenerative inflammatory/immune related diseases that each have shared genetic or lifestyle determinants: (a) cardiovascular disease (b) diabetes (c) rheumatoid arthritis) (d) mental health (e) alzheimer’s (f) cancer including multiple myeloma, prostate, breast and head & neck cancers.  

We are determining the whole genome sequence (WGS), the methylome, transcriptome, proteome, and the microbiome (in sub-sets) of patients recruited in each of the above disease areas. By interrogating their phenotypic and omics data we aim to better inform the diagnoses and treatment, particularly for comorbid conditions that share a pro-inflammatory etiology. This is driving the discovery and validation of biomarkers associated with disease predisposition and response to therapy, and ultimately more effective drugs.

**Project topics**

We are looking for projects that yield tools that better enable us to mine this data for insight. The general challenges we face include i) the automation of analysis, ii) the combinatorial scaling of analysis when subgroups are scanned and iii) the validation of mechanisms driving identified.
