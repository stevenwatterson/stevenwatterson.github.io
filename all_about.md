Cardiovascular disease is responsible for 17 million deaths world-wide each year and 150,000 in the UK.  Cholesterol levels are a known marker of the risk from cardiovascular disease and the World Health Organisation estimated that 2.6 million deaths world wide were attributable to the risk from elevated levels of cholesterol in 2006.  Frighteningly, the World Health Organisation also estimates that 39% of adults world-wide at at risk from elevated levels of cholesterol (>5mmol/l).  Understanding and managing the risk from cholesterol is therefore an important future health aim, particularly in light of a growing global population and the associated scarcity of resources.

 

Cholesterol can be absorbed from diet and is synthesized in the body.  Current pharmaceutical treatments are largely based on the statin class of drug which inhibits synthesis. However cholesterol is synthesised in a long molecular production line and statin acts by targeting a step very close to the start of the production line. This creates problems because the intermediate molecular forms are used in other cellular processes and so statin treatment is associated with not insignificant side-effects.

 

A significant barrier to developing better therapies is that many of the parameters associated with the kinetics of the cholesterol production line are not known.  Also the range of drugs that could be used to target the production line is poorly understood.



Cholesterol is understood to contribute to cardiovascular disease through atherosclerosis. Our interests are in:-

* improving our understanding cholesterol synthesis and metabolism

* better understanding how cholesterol influences the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease

* identifying better pharmaceutical approaches to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease
