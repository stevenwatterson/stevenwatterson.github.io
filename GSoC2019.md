# Ideas List

**Background**

At the Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine, part of Ulster University, we recruited approx. 2500 patients across a range of immune and pro-inflammatory diseases, collecting their clinical data, genome sequence data and protein activity data in order to better learn how to stratify patients into specific sub-groups depending on disease and treatment characteristics.  Our research is focused on following range of degenerative inflammatory/immune related diseases that each have shared genetic or lifestyle determinants: (a) cardiovascular disease, (b) diabetes, (c) rheumatoid arthritis, (d) mental health, (e) alzheimer’s and (f) cancer, including multiple myeloma, prostate, breast and head & neck cancers.  

We have measurements of whole genome sequences, methylation, protein expression and abundence, and the microbiome of patients recruited in each of the above disease areas. By interrogating their phenotypic and omics data we aim to better inform the diagnoses and treatment, particularly for comorbid conditions that share a pro-inflammatory etiology. This work is driving the discovery and validation of biomarkers associated with disease predisposition and response to therapy, with the intenntion of ultimately devising more effective therapies.

**Project topics**

We are looking for projects that yield tools that better enable us to mine this data for insight. The general challenges we face include i) the automation of analysis, ii) the combinatorial scaling of analysis when subgroups are scanned and iii) the validation of mechanisms driving identified.  

**Idea 1 - Your own idea!**

Do you have a background in bioinformatics?  Are there any tools you’d like to develop that are applicable to multi-disease, multi-omic’s data sets?

*Expected outcomems:* You tell use!

*Required skills:* You tell us!

*Potential mentors:* Dr Steven Watterson, Dr Priyank Shukla

*Difficulty rating:* You tell us!

**Idea 2 - Software to simulate health and disease**

We have produced a number of openly available mathematical and computational models of cardiovascular disease.  However, they currently exist in formats that are too obscure for clinicians and lab biologists to use.  We would love to turn these models into easy-to-use predictive software tools with which clinicians or biologist could predict the effect of a mutation or a drug.  

*Expected outcomes:* a piece of desktop software or a web app.

*Required skills:* Project management. GUI development.  An understanding of numerical integration.  We’re largely platform agnostic. An interest in biomedical science would be useful, but not essential.

*Possible mentors:* Dr Steven Watterson, Dr Priyank Shukla

*Difficulty Rating:* Low

**Idea 3 – Automated model optimisation**

We have produced a number of mathematical and computational models of cardiovascular disease at the centre.  An enduring challenge to using these models is that a significant proportion of the parameters have never been measured and must be estimated by fitting to experimental data.  It would be very useful to be able to map out the dynamics of such models across the space of the unknown parameters and to identify the regions of parameter space corresponding to various model dynamics.

*Expected outcomes:* a function or small library.

*Required skills:* Project management. An understanding of numerical integration.  We’re largely platform agnostic. An interest in biomedical science would be useful, but not essential.

*Possible mentors:* Dr Steven Watterson, Dr Priyank Shukla

*Difficulty Rating:* Medium

**Idea 4 – Tools for the identification of patient subgroups**
We currently use machine learning methods with patient data to build predictors of a patients disease or treatment outcomes.  We would be very interested in software tools that enable us identify the patient subgroups for which the accuracy of prediction increases.  This could be done by enumerating all permutations of patient subgroups and globally searching this space for the best performing classifications or locally by undertaking crude sweeps of patient subgroups and then using convergent algorithms (simulated annealing or genetic algorithms) to identify patient subgroups that can be classified effectively. 

*Expected outcomes:* a function or small library.

*Required skills:* Project management. An understanding of machine learning and optimisation.  We’re largely platform agnostic. An interest in biomedical science would be useful, but not essential.
