## Flat maps (images) 

1.  A relatively simple model of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, from Watterson et al., Biochimie 95, 613-21 (2013), available from Biomodels.

 

2. A detailed model of the pre-Squalene section of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, from Mazein et al., Biochemical Pharmacology 86: 1. 56-66 (2013), available from Biomodels.

 

3. A detailed model of the sterol section of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (Shunt, Bloch and Kandutsch-Russell arms), from Mazein et al., Biochemical Pharmacology 86: 1. 56-66 (2013), available from Biomodels.

 

4. A detailed model of the pre-Squalene section of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, from Benson et al. (under review).  Currently under curation at Biomodels.
