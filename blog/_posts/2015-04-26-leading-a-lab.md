# Goal

# Why me? Why now?

Let's dispatch the elephant in the room: I have no right to tell you how to lead a lab. I'm an assistant professor just over halfway through the pre-tenure years. I'm not a luminary. The awards I've won as a scientist mainly recognize potential, not achievement. The number one piece of career advice I receive from my colleagues rotates between "publish" and "get funded."

What's more, I'm still improving as a leader, and I've got some big "opportunities" (as we say in HR).

So why would I stick my neck out?

Because I care, because I have something unique to contribute. Because of the endless hunger for leadership help among my fellow early-career researchers (including me!). And because of something [Mike Eisen] said recently at a [Pew] meeting. 

I can't recall the exact question; it was something along the lines of when we young scientists should get involved in communicating science to the public and to government. Shouldn't we, the question went, just be keeping our heads down and doing science? He answered that he hated that phrase "keeping your head down." He said that in his experience, people never suddenly feel they are successful enough to start contributing broadly. People either contribute, or they don't.

As someone who's been keeping his head down for more than a decade, waiting to feel successful enough, I heard those words like the startling blare of a morning alarm. Time to get up.

# My bona fides

I've been running my own academic research group since October of 2006 (8.5 years, as of now), when I started my lab as a Bauer Fellow at Harvard. I've graduated one student with a Ph.D., co-advised by Dan Hartl.


# Goals for this post

1. Provide a flavor for the lab leadership job, and some simple tools
2. Encourage thinking about leadership in science
3. Start a conversation


# Resistance to leadership in science

Why do so many successful scientists display disinterest, disdain, or extreme skepticism about the role of leadership in science? I'm not sure, but I do have some strong hypotheses.

## The Natural



## The Fallacy of Implicit Perfection

"I've never given a minute's thought to your so-called 'principles of leadership,' and I've done just fine," says the Nobel laureate. 

I'm sure both of those statements are true. They're not at issue. The question is whether thinking about 

## Fear (of the Unknown, of being Industrial)



## Purity Enforcement Squad

"I think you should just focus on doing great science." 

"Once you start thinking about those sorts of things, I think you pretty quickly lose your way as a scientist."

The worry here is
