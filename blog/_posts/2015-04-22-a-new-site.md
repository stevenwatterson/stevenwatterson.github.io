Our new lab website is up and running. My goal with this site is to change how we communicate our science to the world, and to help others to get over barriers to that change. 

In terms of technology adoption, I believe we are [early majority][1] types. That means the technology we're using is relatively mature--we're not risking much--but most people in our sphere aren't yet using it. If you're looking for [innovation][1] or are an [early adopter][1], you'll find this site to be hopelessly outdated!

## Open

The site is fully open source, available in a [GitHub repository][2]. 

## Connected

Just as critical scientific interactions have taken place by correspondence and at scientific meetings, many such interactions now take place online in social media. [Data][dryad] and [figures][figshare] now have homes in online repositories. (This stuff is forehead-slappingly obvious to some, and news to others.)
