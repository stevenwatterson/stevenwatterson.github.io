> _Note: [Edward][1] sang the ditty below to us at his going-away party. He was the group's first postdoc, a scientist of tremendous range who trained as a mathematician and mastered [computational molecular evolution][2], then [experimental biochemistry][3], during his tenure. Now he's off to start his Marie Curie fellowship in Edinburgh. He is greatly admired, and already deeply missed. -- Allan_

O Drummond Lab
==============
(to the tune of "Shenandoah")

O Drummond lab, how I shall miss you,  
At the bench and the computer,  
And all the fine science that you do.  
Away, I must away, across the vast Atlantic.  

For five long years I've toiled away,  
At the bench and the computer,  
Measuring proteins and RNA.  
Away, I must away, across the vast Atlantic.  

All you have taught me so, so much,  
At the bench and the computer,  
Of biochemistry, evolution, cell biology, statistics, biophysics\*, and such.  
Away, I must away, across the vast Atlantic.  

O Drummond lab, you lovely colleagues,  
At the bench and the computer,  
And a quintillion heat-shocked yeasties.  
Away, I must away, across the vast Atlantic.  

\*Creative interpretation is needed to fit all these fields in a single line, or single postdoc.
