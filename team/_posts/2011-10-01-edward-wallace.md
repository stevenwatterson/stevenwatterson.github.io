Dr. Wallace did his postdoctoral work in the Drummond Lab at the [University of Chicago] in the Department of [Biochemistry & Molecular Biology]. In January 2016, Dr. Wallace will start a [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) at [The University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home), working with [Guido Sanguinetti](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gsanguin/) and [Jean Beggs](http://beggs.bio.ed.ac.uk/).

Dr. Wallace received his Ph.D. in [Mathematics](UCMath), also at the [University of Chicago], working with [Jack Cowan](http://neuroscience.uchicago.edu/?p=neuro/profile&id=63) on stochastic dynamics of biological networks. He joined the Drummond Lab, then at the [FAS Center for Systems Biology](http://sysbio.harvard.edu/home), in 2010, and has since added experimental capabilities to his computational training.
